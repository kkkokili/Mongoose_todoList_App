## Check Out the APP: [To-Do-List App](https://fierce-castle-96071.herokuapp.com/work)<br/><br/>

### The Express Deployed Weather Fetch Web APP utilizes the data of [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as raw material. It first presents a web page where users could input the latitude and longitude of a location, and then the realtime weather condition in the moment as well as that in the next 7 days will be loaded.</br>

## SKILLS:
#### It covers the topic of **_HTML, CSS,Js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and Heroku**<br/><br/>


## HOW DOES IT WORK:
#### The project is deployed by Node.js and hosted on Heroku.  The repo contains the backend file: app. js which I tested locally by running it through by nodemon (a package installed through npm: node package manager) to simplify the node.js restart procedures in terminal. <br/><br/>
